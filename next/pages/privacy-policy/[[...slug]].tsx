                        <p>At SystemLimited we have a few fundamental principles that we follow:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>We don’t ask you for personal information unless we truly need it. (We can’t stand services that ask you for things like your gender or income level for no apparent reason.)</li>
                            <li>We don’t share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.</li>
                            <li>We don’t store unencrypted personal information on our servers unless required for the on-going operation of our site.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>SystemLimited (“SystemLimited”) operates several websites including SystemLimited.io. It is SystemLimited’s policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our websites.</p>
                        <p><strong>Website Visitors</strong></p>
                        <p>Like most website operators, SystemLimited collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. SystemLimited’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how SystemLimited’s visitors use its website. From time to time, SystemLimited may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>
                        <p>SystemLimited also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on our blogs. SystemLimited only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below, except that blog commenter IP addresses are visible and disclosed to the administrators of the blog where the comment was left.</p>
                        <p><strong>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</strong></p>
                        <p>Certain visitors to SystemLimited’s websites choose to interact with SystemLimited in ways that require SystemLimited to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that SystemLimited gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who comment on our blog to provide a username and email address. Those who wish to receive SystemLimited updates via email, we collect their emails. In each case, SystemLimited collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with SystemLimited. SystemLimited does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.</p>
                        <p><strong>Aggregated Statistics</strong></p>
                        <p>SystemLimited may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. For instance, SystemLimited may monitor the most popular pages on the SystemLimited.io site or use spam screened by the Fingerprint service to help identify spam. SystemLimited may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, SystemLimited does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.</p>
                        <p><strong>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</strong></p>
                        <p>SystemLimited discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on SystemLimited’s behalf or to provide services available at SystemLimited’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using SystemLimited’s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. SystemLimited will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, SystemLimited discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when SystemLimited believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of SystemLimited, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of an SystemLimited website and have supplied your email address, SystemLimited may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with SystemLimited and our products. We primarily use our various product blogs to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. SystemLimited takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</p>
                        <p><strong>Cookies</strong></p>
                        <p>A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. SystemLimited uses cookies to help SystemLimited identify and track visitors, their usage of SystemLimited website, and their website access preferences. SystemLimited visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using SystemLimited’s websites, with the drawback that certain features of SystemLimited’s websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.</p>
                        <p><strong>Usage Tracking</strong></p>
                        <p>SystemLimited collects certain information through usage tracking. The purpose of usage tracking helps SystemLimited to better understand our users and their website needs by looking at a range of variables in their SystemLimited plugin, WordPress, and web host. This information allows us to continuously improve our product as well as our Q&amp;A / testing process. The information may include the license key (and type), plugin activation dates,  form and entry statistics to help us make sure our features and updates get tested in situations that closely match our customers’ site environments and SystemLimited usage. In addition, SystemLimited may collect statistics for its SystemLimited Challenge that includes whether the challenge was started, whether it was completed, and how long it took in order to continue to improve the onboarding experience. We may also collect information of active integrations and plugin settings but sensitive settings such as API keys are automatically excluded from tracking.</p>
                        <p>Our usage tracking includes collecting information as to the WordPress active theme/plugins, locale, timezone, whether SSL enabled, or if a site is a multisite, and the site URL.  In addition, the usage tracking includes determining the PHP and MySQL Versions in order to help us make sure our testing procedures have proper coverage to avoid compatibility issues, and determining the server software, which is used for testing purposes.</p>
                        <p>We may also collect non-sensitive information of user such as Language, GEO, Email etc.. to better understand our users, prioritize translations accordingly and get-in-touch in-case in-case any issue arise or we need more information.</p>
                        <p>Opting Out of Usage Tracking:</p>
                        <p>To disable this, please go to SystemLimited &gt; Settings &gt; Usage Tracking. On this screen, you’ll be able to enable or disable usage tracking.</p>

                        <p>If SystemLimited, or substantially all of its assets were acquired, or in the unlikely event that SystemLimited goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of SystemLimited may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.</p>

                        <p>Ads appearing on any of our websites may be delivered to users by advertising partners, who may set cookies.

This information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by SystemLimited and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.</p>
